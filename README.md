**I. Descirption**

This is simple Cricket Analysis on Indian Premier League tournament implemented by using Ms Excel. In this project i have analyzed all the awards by each team individually from First to Present Seasons. I have already created the project on IPL Analysis using Power BI. Similarly making use of same data this project executed, In Ms Excel i have kept the visualization simple which would be easy for Analyzing the data.

**II. Technology Stack**

Language: Excel

IDE used: Microsoft Excel 2019 (16.0.10373.20050)

**III. Objective**

Check the data of the all seasons played by the each teams, And also Analyze the data of each 
team by the their titles from first season which was held in 2008 to present season 2023. 

**IV. Procedures:**

**1.Data Gathering & Data Cleaning:**

Created Excel file. And Performed various activities like checking for duplicates & removing it,
And transforming the data into a format that can be easily analyzed.


**2.Data Visualization:**

To represent information or data into Pictorial format, A Most commonly used tool is Visualization.
Where in this IPL Analysis Dashboard Visualization tools like "Stacked Bar graph", "Column charts", "Pie chart" & "Area Charts", were used to the data. 
I have shown Titles won by the Captains and Teams. The objective of a visual is to introduce information in a way that gives setting and experiences, 
Both of which would almost certainly hard to perceive from a crude table of numbers or content.

**3. Reports:**

In Ms Excel, A report is a gathering of perceptions that seem together on at least one page but in this project i have represented the data into Grapical format in more than 6 sheets that is in 6 Pages. Ms Excel allows to report an accumulation of things that identify with each other. 
I have also created the visuals in a such way that it would be easy to understand for the End-User. One can understand the data by seeing the visuals in the Reports. 

**4. Insights Drawn:**

Captains with their respective teams & titles is shown, Number of Appearances in the finals of individual teams. 
Orange, Purple Cap by the teams and Fair play awards is also shown.
